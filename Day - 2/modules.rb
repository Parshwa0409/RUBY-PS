# Modules can be used o avoid any name conflicts

    Ruby doesnâ€™t handle multiple inheritance.
    So how to organize a class to keep it maintainable in the long term?
    The answer is by applying the Composition over Inheritance principle.

    include 
        - need an instance to call any meth() of included module, 
        - maked the included module the immediate ancestor/parent of the class
    
    extend
        - no need to have the instace to call the meth() or access the variables of the extened module
    
    prepend 
        - the module becomes the child in the ancestor chain for the given-class
        - so if class has meth-x() & module has meth-x(), if we call meth-x() through class, we start check for that method in ancestor chain & since module is prepended it will be the first encounter where we check for meth-x() and  since it is present there module's meth-x() is executed

# static call result like prepend
